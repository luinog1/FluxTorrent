# ◖ FluxTorrent

**A simple, efficient, self-hosted torrent → HTTP streaming bridge with a web UI.**

Turn a magnet/infohash into a seekable HTTP stream on demand for any media player
(mpv, VLC, Infuse…) — focused, modern, **private-tracker friendly**, and **compatible with the
APIs your clients already speak** (TorrServer, Stremio, torrent2http).

## What is it?

FluxTorrent does exactly one job and does it well: it turns a **torrent into a seekable
HTTP URL on demand**, with smart piece prioritization so playback starts fast and seeking
doesn't stall. It's a *thin streaming engine*, not a download manager.

You paste a magnet link, FluxTorrent fetches just the pieces your player needs (around the
current playback position), and exposes a standard **HTTP Range** endpoint any video player
understands. Bounded memory, smart seeding, per-source rules, and a clean web UI round it out.

**Design goals:** robust, efficient, single-purpose, simple. Every feature serves streaming
playback, on principles that keep a small always-on box happy: idempotent start (a torrent is
either active or fully gone — never a stuck *"finding peers… 0/0"* zombie), a **bounded RAM
ring buffer** so memory stays predictable, drop-after-playback so torrents don't pile up, and a
no-peers timeout that fails fast instead of hanging.

It stands on the shoulders of the projects that defined this space —
**[TorrServer](https://github.com/YouROK/TorrServer)**, **[Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/)**
and **torrent2http** — and stays **API-compatible** with them so it fits the clients people
already use.

## 🔒 Private-first

Most torrent streamers treat private trackers as an afterthought. FluxTorrent is built to be a
**good citizen on private trackers** out of the box:

- **Auto-detects private torrents** (the BEP27 `private` flag) — no per-tracker setup needed.
- **Smart seeding to satisfy ratio/time** — automatically seeds a private torrent until it
  reaches your target **ratio _or_ seed time** (whichever first), then releases it. This is the
  classic hit-and-run rule, handled for you. Progress is persisted, so seeding survives restarts.
- **Forces disk storage** for private torrents (you can't seed what RAM discards) and downloads
  the full content so there's something to share.
- **No leaks** — private torrents never use DHT/PEX/LSD (enforced by the protocol), and you can
  **force header encryption** to get past torrent-blocking ISPs.
- **Per-source rules** can fine-tune any source further (seed targets, storage mode, connection
  caps), useful when a private tracker has specific requirements.

It's all configurable (or off) in **Settings → Private trackers**.

## Features

- 🎬 **Instant streaming** — magnet/infohash → seekable HTTP (`206 Partial Content`), fast start, smooth seeks.
- 🧠 **Bounded cache** — pure **RAM** (memory-capped ring buffer) or **disk** (configurable path).
- 🔒 **Private-tracker smart seeding** — auto-detect + seed to ratio/time, then drop. Survives restarts.
- 🧭 **Per-source rules** — `reject` / `prefer` / `forceDisk` / `forceRam` / `keepSeed` (+ per-torrent connection cap), first match wins, editable in the UI.
- 📦 **Compressed-release detection** — flags/rejects RAR/ZIP/split archives a player can't use.
- 🔌 **Drop-in compatible** — speaks **TorrServer**, **Stremio** and **torrent2http** APIs, so existing clients just re-point. ([details](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md))
- 🖥️ **Web UI** — sortable torrent table, resizable panels, detail tabs, live WebSocket stats, **dark theme**, **multi-language (es/en, extensible)**.
- 👁️ **Full visibility** — mode (streaming vs sharing), rule target, source (seeders) and **which client is playing** (player + IP), at a glance.
- 🚦 **Speed & network control** — global download/upload caps, connection limit, DHT/IPv6/µTP, header encryption, idle disconnect timeout.
- 🪶 **Single binary, single container** — UI embedded via `go:embed`, ~25 MB image, ultra-light at idle, graceful shutdown.

## How it compares

An honest look at where FluxTorrent fits. These are all good tools with different goals —
FluxTorrent is a **focused single-purpose engine**, not a media center.

| | **FluxTorrent** | TorrServer | Stremio (server) | torrent2http / Peerflix |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Primary focus | Torrent→HTTP **streaming engine** | Torrent→HTTP streaming server | Media center + streaming server | Minimal torrent→HTTP CLI |
| Bounded RAM cache | ✅ ring buffer | ✅ | ⚠️ disk/temp | ❌ |
| Disk mode + seeding | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | partial |
| **Private-tracker smart seeding** (ratio/time, auto) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Per-source rules** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Modern web UI | ✅ | ⚠️ basic | ✅ (full app) | ❌ |
| Speaks **other servers' APIs** | ✅ TorrServer · Stremio · torrent2http | — | — | — |
| See the playing client (player + IP) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Transcoding | ❌ *(by design)* | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Catalogs / indexers / addons | ❌ *(by design)* | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Single binary / small container | ✅ ~25 MB | ✅ | ⚠️ bundled with app | ✅ |
| Ecosystem & maturity | 🆕 new, small | 🏆 large, battle-tested | 🏆 huge | mature but niche |

**Be honest with yourself about what you need:**

- Want a **full media center** with catalogs, addons and transcoding? → **Stremio**.
- Want the **most battle-tested** option with the widest Android/Kodi client support and a big
  community? → **TorrServer**.
- Want a **focused, memory-bounded engine** that's a good citizen on **private trackers**, has
  **per-source rules** and a clean UI, and **drops into clients built for the tools above**?
  → that's where **FluxTorrent** aims to shine. It's newer and its ecosystem is smaller — that's
  the honest trade-off.

## 🚀 Quick start (Docker, recommended)

```bash
docker run -d --name fluxtorrent \
  -p 7001:7001 \
  -p 42069:42069 \
  -v "$PWD/config:/config" \
  -v "$PWD/downloads:/downloads" \
  -e FT_CACHE_MODE=ram \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/jodacame/fluxtorrent:latest
```

Open **http://localhost:7001**, paste a magnet link, press play. Point any player at
`http://<host>:7001/stream/<hash>/<index>`.

### docker-compose (with persistence)

```yaml
services:
  fluxtorrent:
    image: ghcr.io/jodacame/fluxtorrent:latest   # or build: .
    container_name: fluxtorrent
    ports:
      - "7001:7001"        # API + UI + stream (bound 0.0.0.0)
      - "42069:42069"      # BitTorrent (optional, for incoming peers)
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config         # ← settings, rules, seed/ratio state (bbolt db)
      - ./downloads:/downloads   # ← downloaded files (disk-cache mode only)
    environment:
      - FT_CACHE_MODE=ram        # ram = stream only · disk = save to disk
      - FT_CACHE_SIZE_MB=1024
      - FT_AUTH_PASSWORD=        # set to require a UI login (empty = open)
      - FT_API_TOKEN=            # optional bearer token for machine clients
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Making your data persistent

FluxTorrent keeps **all state in two folders** — mount them as volumes and your setup
survives restarts, upgrades and re-creates:

| Volume | Holds | Needed when |
|---|---|---|
| `/config` | bbolt DB: **settings, rules, seed/ratio state, torrent list** | always (recommended) |
| `/downloads` | the actual media files | only in **disk** cache mode |

In **RAM mode** nothing is written to `/downloads` (pure streaming). In **disk mode** files
persist there, which is what enables seeding and resume. Your `keepSeed` ratio/time progress
lives in `/config`, so private-tracker seeding continues across restarts.

> **Migrating from another server?** Run FluxTorrent on the same port your client used
> (`-e FT_LISTEN_PORT=8090 -p 8090:8090`) and existing TorrServer/Stremio clients keep working
> unchanged — saved stream URLs resolve as-is. See [docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Configuration

Everything is editable in the **Settings** screen (with a built-in help guide) and persisted to
`/config`. It can also be booted from environment variables:

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FT_LISTEN_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `FT_LISTEN_PORT` | `7001` | API + UI + stream port |
| `FT_BT_PORT` | `42069` | Incoming BitTorrent port |
| `FT_CACHE_MODE` | `ram` | `ram` (stream only) or `disk` (save + seed) |
| `FT_CACHE_SIZE_MB` | `1024` | RAM ring-buffer cap |
| `FT_CACHE_PATH` | `/downloads` | Disk-mode storage root |
| `FT_READAHEAD_MB` | `64` | Bytes prioritized ahead of playback |
| `FT_API_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | Optional `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for `/api/*` (machine clients) |
| `FT_AUTH_PASSWORD` | _(empty)_ | Set to require a **password login** on the UI + `/api/*`. Empty = no login |
| `FT_AUTH_SESSION_HOURS` | `168` | How long a UI login stays valid (session cookie lifetime) |
| `FT_CONFIG_DIR` | `/config` | Where the bbolt DB lives |

From the UI you can also tune: download/upload speed limits, max active torrents, no-peers
timeout, seeding defaults, the disk folder, and an **Advanced** section — DHT, connection
limit, **force header encryption**, IPv6, µTP, and an idle **disconnect timeout**.

### Memory budget (RAM mode)

`FT_CACHE_SIZE_MB` caps the **piece payload** held in the ring buffer, not the whole process.
Pieces still in flight, per-peer buffers and Go's heap add on top — the more peers a torrent
has, the bigger that margin. On a well-seeded torrent resident memory settles at roughly
**1.2–1.5×** the cap.

FluxTorrent bounds its own heap accordingly at startup (`cache + 25%`), and clamps that to
your container's memory limit if it can't fit, logging a warning rather than being
OOM-killed mid-playback. Give the container about **1.5× the cache** and it stays clean:

```yaml
environment:
  - FT_CACHE_SIZE_MB=1024
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 1536M     # ~1.5x the cache
```

Set `GOMEMLIMIT` explicitly if you'd rather pick the ceiling yourself.

### Authentication (`FT_AUTH_PASSWORD`)

By default FluxTorrent is **open** — anyone who can reach the port uses it. Set
**`FT_AUTH_PASSWORD`** to require a single password to open the UI:

```yaml
environment:
  - FT_AUTH_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-password
  # - FT_AUTH_SESSION_HOURS=168   # optional: how long a login lasts (default 7 days)
```

- **Empty (default) → no login**, everything stays open (unchanged behavior).
- **Set → a login screen gates the UI.** A successful login issues an **HttpOnly,
  SameSite** session cookie (marked **`Secure`** automatically when served over HTTPS),
  valid for `FT_AUTH_SESSION_HOURS` (default **168 h / 7 days**). There is **no password
  recovery** — it's the value of the env var; change the variable and restart to rotate it.
- Login attempts are **rate-limited per IP** (5 failures → a short lockout) and the
  password is compared in constant time.
- **What stays open for players** (they can't log in interactively): `/stream`, `/echo`,
  and the compat actions a player needs to play — `add` / `get` / `drop` on `/torrents`.
  The **mutating** compat actions (`rem`, `set`, and `set` on `/settings`) are gated too.
- **`FT_API_TOKEN`** is independent and for **machine clients**: send
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to reach `/api/*` and the gated actions without a browser
  session. Either a valid session **or** the bearer token is accepted.

> Going public? Always put it behind **TLS** (a reverse proxy) so the session cookie is
> `Secure`, and prefer a **VPN** when you can. See [Security](#security).

### Disk cleanup (disk mode)

In **RAM mode** nothing is written to disk, so there's nothing to clean. In **disk mode**
FluxTorrent frees space automatically so `/downloads` never fills up. Tune it in the
**Settings → Disk cleanup** screen:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Disk limit (GB)** | `0` = off | Hard cap for the download folder. When exceeded, the **oldest unused** content is deleted first until back under the cap. |
| **Safety window (min)** | `60` | After content is no longer needed it's kept this long before deletion, so replaying it **resumes without re-downloading**. |
| **Delete after sharing** | `on` | Free the files once a torrent meets its seed **ratio/time** target. |
| **Delete after watching** | `on` | Remove leftover files after you finish watching or a torrent goes idle. |

**What is kept:** anything **being watched right now** or **still seeding toward a live
target** is never touched. **Private torrents** manage their own ratio/time window, so they're
deleted **immediately** when it's met (no safety window). Everything else is retired: dropped
from the active set, kept for the safety window (so a returning viewer resumes instantly), then
deleted. When the **disk limit** is hit, FluxTorrent reconciles against what's actually on
disk and evicts the **oldest inactive** content first — including untracked leftovers (files a
client `rem` or a delete-without-files left behind) — overriding the safety window until it's
back under the cap.

> ⚠️ Because the disk limit reclaims **any** inactive file under the download folder, point
> `FT_CACHE_PATH` at a folder FluxTorrent owns — **don't share it with other apps' data**.

### Per-source rules

Rules are evaluated **in order, first match wins** (edit them in the **Rules** screen):

- **`keepSeed`** — download fully, save to disk, and seed until `maxRatio` **or** `maxMinutes`
  is reached (whichever first; `0` = ∞), then drop. Ideal for private trackers.
- **`forceDisk` / `forceRam`** — override the storage mode for matching torrents.
- **`reject`** — refuse a flaky source (with a reason returned to the client).
- **`prefer`** — bias peer selection / keep-alive priority.
- Any rule can also set a **per-torrent connection cap** (override), handy for private trackers.

Anything that matches no rule simply **streams in RAM** and is dropped after playback.

## Compatibility

The torrent-streaming space has excellent prior art, and rather than reinvent client protocols
FluxTorrent **implements the APIs those projects established** — so the players and front-ends
already built for them work here unchanged:

| Server | Transparency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **TorrServer** (MatriX) | Full | `/echo`, `/torrents`, `/stream`, `/play`, `/settings` |
| **Stremio** (streaming server) | Full | root-level `/{infoHash}/{fileIdx}`, `/create`, `/stats.json` |
| **torrent2http** (Kodi/Quasar) | Best-effort | single-torrent API; targets `?hash=` or the latest torrent |

Full endpoint mapping and the list of clients that work unchanged:
**[docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)**.

## API

Base: `http://<host>:7001`. Native, documented surface (prefer this for new integrations):

```
POST   /api/torrents        { "link": "magnet:…" | "infohash" }
GET    /api/torrents        → list with live stats
GET    /api/torrents/:hash  → one torrent (stats, files, clients)
POST   /api/torrents/:hash/drop
DELETE /api/torrents/:hash  (?withFiles=true)
GET    /stream/:hash/:index → Range-capable video bytes  ← players
GET/PUT /api/settings
GET/PUT /api/rules
WS     /api/events          → live { type:"stats", torrents:[…] }
GET    /api/health
```

The stream URL is **stable and token-free** so saved player URLs survive restarts.

## Building from source

Requires Go 1.23+ and Node 18+.

```bash
# 1. build the embedded UI
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# 2. build the single binary (UI baked in)
go build -o fluxtorrent ./cmd/fluxtorrent

# 3. run
FT_CONFIG_DIR=./config ./fluxtorrent      # → http://localhost:7001
```

Or just `docker build -t fluxtorrent .` (multi-stage: Node builds the UI → Go embeds it →
tiny Alpine runtime).

## Tech stack

`web/src/i18n/locales/`. Open an issue to discuss larger changes first.

If FluxTorrent is useful to you, consider **[sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/jodacame)** ❤ — it helps keep the project maintained.

## Security

FluxTorrent is a **self-hosted service meant for a trusted network**. By default it
has **no authentication**, permissive CORS, and binds `0.0.0.0` — anyone who can
reach the port can control it.

- Set **`FT_AUTH_PASSWORD`** to require a **password login** on the UI. It issues an
  HttpOnly, SameSite session cookie (default 7 days) and gates the UI + `/api/*`.
  Login attempts are rate-limited per IP. Leave it empty to keep the UI open.
- Set **`FT_API_TOKEN`** to also accept an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/api/*`
  for machine clients (scripts, integrations). Either a valid session or the bearer
  token is accepted.
- Both guard the **UI, all `/api/*`, and the mutating player-compat actions**
  (`rem`/`set` on `/torrents`, `set` on `/settings`). What a player actually needs to
  play — `add`/`get`/`drop`, `/stream`, `/echo` — **stays open by design** so external
  players (Kodi/Stremio/VLC) work without credentials. Stream URLs require the torrent
  infohash, which is effectively unguessable.
- To expose it publicly, **always add TLS** (a reverse proxy) and prefer keeping it
  behind a **VPN** when you can.

## Built with AI

FluxTorrent was built **100% with AI, under human supervision** — an experiment in modern,
AI-native software development.

A human set the direction, made the product and architecture decisions, reviewed every change
and validated the result; an AI agent did the implementation — engine, compatibility layers,
UI, tests, Docker and CI — iterating from a written specification and continuous feedback. Each
feature was verified end-to-end (real torrents, real streaming, live screenshots) before being
accepted.

This is a deliberate showcase of where software development is heading: humans steering intent,
taste and judgment; AI handling the implementation at speed. The code is meant to be read,
audited and improved like any other — the workflow that produced it just happens to be new.
